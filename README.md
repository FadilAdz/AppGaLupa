The "Galupa" UI Design is a user interface concept for a To Do List application, created to help users stay organized and avoid forgetting their tasks. The design includes key screens such as the splash screen, login, sign-up, agenda list, and agenda editor, all arranged with a clean and intuitive layout. The logo reflects a philosophy of structure and precision in goal achievement, with a checklist symbol representing a systematic task completion process. The color scheme uses soft greens and neutral grays to create a calm yet professional look. Fonts used are Inter and Poppins, both chosen for their screen readability and modern appearance. This design was created using Figma and presented in a visual format ready for further development.
